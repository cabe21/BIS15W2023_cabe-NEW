## Seating & Set-up
1. Please make sure that you sit next to your group members for the rest of the quarter.
2. Please set-up your computer as normal.

## Warm-up
For this warm-up, please use the `heartrate` data. Be sure to label your plots!
```{r}
heartrate <- read.csv(here("data", "heartrate.csv"))
```

1. Make a plot that compares the heartrate of patients for drug a.
```{r}
heartrate %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=patient, y=a, fill = patient))+
    geom_col() 
labs(Title= "Heartrate of paitents", x= NULL, y= "heartrate")

```

2. Make a plot that compares heartrate (as a range) for each drug.
```{r}
heartrate %>% 
  pivot_longer(~patient, names_to="drug", values_to = "heartrate")
  GGPLOT(aes())
```

```{r}
heartrate %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=patient, y=a)+ 
  geom_boxplot()

```
